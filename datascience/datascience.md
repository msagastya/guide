# Data Science Repository
Welcome to my personal data science repository!
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files focusing on fundamental data manipulation and analysis libraries,
including NumPy and pandas. Here, you will find notebooks that explore the capabilities and usage of these libraries to perform various data-related tasks. 
Additionally, this repository will be regularly updated to include machine learning tutorials, expanding the scope to cover advanced data science 
concepts and techniques in the future. Stay tuned for upcoming tutorials on machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and more!

## Notebooks
This section highlights the notebooks available in this repository:

* [NumPy Basics](https://github.com/saurabhanilpandey/guide/blob/main/datascience/notebooks/Notebook-1.ipynb):   
This notebook provides an introduction to the essential features and functionalities of NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
It covers topics such as array creation, indexing, slicing, mathematical operations, and more.

* [Pandas Introduction](https://github.com/saurabhanilpandey/guide/blob/main/datascience/notebooks/Notebook-2.ipynb):   
This notebook serves as an introduction to pandas, a widely-used library for data manipulation and analysis.
It explores pandas' key data structures, including Series and DataFrame,
and demonstrates various operations such as data loading, cleaning, filtering, and basic data exploration.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to deepen your understanding of NumPy and pandas and enhance your data manipulation and analysis skills.
